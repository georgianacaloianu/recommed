(Editor) Aagenaes syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by impaired bile flow from the liver resulting in cholestasis. Image Credit: Magic Mine/Shutterstock.com Blockage of bile secretion (hepatic cholestasis) results in swelling and fluid retention ( lymphedema ) in the lower extremities. Neonatal cholestasis in patients with Aagenaes syndrome usually diminishes during early childhood, but remains intermittent in nature. Despite this, \u00a0Aagenaes syndrome often gradually develops into cirrhosis of liver and giant-cell hepatitis accompanied by scarring of the portal tract tissues. The disorder is also referred to as lymphedema cholestasis syndrome (LSC1) or cholestasis-lymphedema syndrome (CLS). Symptoms and diagnosis of Aagenaes syndrome According to the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database, the most frequent symptoms of Aagenaes syndrome are abdominal pain , swollen legs, obstructive liver disease, abnormality of urine homeostasis, clay-colored (acholic) stools, and fatigue. Other symptoms include enlarged liver, liver scarring, abnormal lipid metabolism, and biliary tract abnormalities. Unfortunately, there are currently no validated diagnostic tests for the condition. Aagenaes syndrome is diagnosed by evaluation of the symptoms and co-morbidities such as lymphedema.

A correlation study between time-from-vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections A quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosol production The disorder is idiopathic and familial in nature. The exact genetic cause remains inconclusive. However, it is considered to be recessively inherited. The gene is located on chromosome 15q. The condition is mainly observed in infants from Norwegian origin, with more than 50% cases being observed in southern Norway. However, it is also prevalent in individuals from other European regions and the United States. Research on Aagenaes syndrome In a whole-genome screen analysis by Bull et al. (2000), the regions considered similar in the patients with Aagenaes syndrome were identified. The most promising regions were further mapped in larger sets of Norwegian individuals, DNA samples from 8 patients and their 7 non-symptomatic relatives from the same ancestral lineage were evaluated. The results revealed an extensive similarity in the alleles and haploid genotype of the patients over a region on the chromosome 15q between D15S979 and D15S652 markers, the characteristic which was absent in the unaffected relatives. This finding suggested that all the Norwegian patients with Aagenaes syndrome could be homozygous with similar gene mutation inherited in dormant form via a common ancestor. Managing Aagenaes syndrome There are no established therapeutic options available for curing this disorder. Treatments mainly target specific symptoms especially concerning lymphedema. Living with a genetic or rare disease can significantly affect the daily lives of patients and their families. As there is a huge scope for further research towards finding a definitive cure for this ailment, community care and support groups are of pivotal importance. Support and advocacy groups can help patients connect with others with similar condition. These groups provide patient-centred information and are the driving force behind research for better treatments and possible cures. Advisors in these groups help direct patients and their family members to research, resources, and services pertaining to this disorder.

    "https://www.news-medical.net/health/Milk-Allergy.aspx": " By Sally Robertson, B.Sc. Reviewed by Dr. Tomislav Me\u0161trovi\u0107, MD, Ph.D. Milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies among children, with around 3% to 6% of infants and young children developing the allergy by the time they are a few months old. Children usually outgrow this allergy by the age of five, thus it is very uncommon among older children and adults. Image Copyright: absolutimages / Shutterstock Milk allergy is caused by the immune system having an abnormal reaction to milk and products that contain milk. The most common culprit is the proteins found in cow\u2019s milk, although an allergic response may also be triggered by consuming milk from other mammals such as sheep, goats or buffalo. Milk allergy should be distinguished from lactose intolerance, which is not an allergic condition and does not involve the immune system. Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose (the sugar present in milk) due to a lack of the enzyme lactase which breaks the lactose down. Lactose intolerance causes different symptoms to milk allergy and may lead to digestive problems after the consumption of milk. Cause of milk allergy The immune system mistakes the proteins in milk for a harmful substance or allergen, which triggers the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to fight off the allergen. The next time a person ingests milk proteins, the IgE antibodies identify them and flag them up to the immune system. This in turn causes the releases or histamine and other chemicals that bring on the symptoms of an allergic reaction. The two main proteins contained in cow\u2019s milk that trigger this reaction are casein (found in the curd of milk) and whey (found in the liquid part of milk). Symptoms An allergic reaction to milk usually occurs within minutes of exposure with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms may include wheezing, digestive problems, hives, vomiting and wheezing. In some cases, the allergy can trigger a more severe reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life threatening. Related Stories Key immunological changes that support peanut allergy remission in children discovered Combination bNAb therapy may offer a future alternative to daily ART for people living with HIV Studies provide insight into how long COVID-19 immunity lasts and nature of immune recall The signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis may include constricted airways, a swollen throat making it difficult to breathe, a marked fall in blood pressure, facial flushing and itching. A person experiencing this reaction requires emergency treatment with a shot of epinephrine, the only drug that can reverse these symptoms. Risk factors Certain factors increase the likelihood of someone developing a milk allergy and these include the following: Existing allergies \u2013 many children who develop a milk allergy also have other allergies Atopic dermatitis \u2013 a chronic skin inflammation A family history of allergies such as asthma, hay fever or eczema Age \u2013 young children are more likely to develop a milk allergy than older children or adolescents. As a child grows up and their digestive system matures, the likelihood of them developing a milk allergy is reduced Diagnosis If a doctor suspects that a child has a milk allergy, they will ask questions about the child\u2019s signs and symptoms, perform a physical assessment and ask that a diary is kept detailing what the child eats. They may ask that milk is eliminated from the diet and then added back to the diet to see if it causes a reaction. The doctor may also recommend a skin prick test, where a small amount of milk protein is applied to the skin to see if a hive develops and/or a blood test to check the amount of IgE antibodies in the blood. Differential diagnoses include various metabolic disorders, coeliac disease and other enteropathies, insufficiency of the pancreas, non\u2010immunological adverse reactions to certain foods (such as secondary lactose intolerance or fructose malabsorption), allergic tendencies to other food allergens, as well as certain infections. Management The main approach to treating this allergy is to avoid consuming milk or milk products, although this can be difficult as milk is a common ingredient in so many foods. If a person needs to avoid consuming cow\u2019s milk, they should remember that the milk is present in many products including the following: Milk powder Butter Cheese Milk drinks Ice cream Margarine Yoghurt Cream Food items for which the following ingredients are listed may also contain cow\u2019s milk or cow milk products: Milk solids Skimmed milk Casein Hydrolyzed casein Non-fat milk Lactose Milk sugar solids Whey Whey syrup sweetener The following processed foods may also contain milk: Soup Pasta and pizza Cereal Instant mash Baby foods Processed meats such as sausages Cakes and biscuits Crackers Custard Batters and pancakes Sauces Gravies Crisps Chocolate Ready-made meals If a child does accidentally consume milk, antihistamines can be taken to help reduce the symptoms of an allergic reaction and relieve discomfort. If a child is at risk of developing anaphylaxis, they may be prescribed injectable epinephrine, which will need to be available at all times.

    "https://www.news-medical.net/health/Asthma-Symptoms.aspx": " By Susha Cheriyedath, M.Sc. Reviewed by Yolanda Smith, B.Pharm. The symptoms of asthma may vary in different people and from one time to another. Symptoms also vary in their frequency. In some people, symptoms occur every few months, while others show symptoms every other week or even every day. Asthma symptoms can last for a few minutes to several days. Common symptoms of asthma include the following: Coughing - Coughing due to asthma often gets worse during early morning or night affecting sleep and often bringing up mucus or phlegm. Shortness of breath - People having asthma often feel breathless or out of breath, as if they can't get enough air out of their lungs. Wheezing - Wheezing refers to high-pitched whistling or squeaky sounds while breathing. Chest tightness - Chest tightness often feels like the chest is being squeezed. Emergency Asthma Symptoms During a severe asthma attack, the airways could become very narrow and enough oxygen cannot get into the blood and in turn to the vital organs causing a medical emergency. Such severe asthma attacks can be fatal and need immediate medical help. Key symptoms of emergency asthma include the following: Bluish colored lips and face due to oxygen deprivation Rapid pulse Reduced alertness, drowsiness or confusion Severe anxiety as a result of shortness of breath Extreme difficulty in breathing Sweating profusely Other major symptoms that may occur during an emergency asthma attack are abnormal breathing pattern, temporary pauses in breathing, and chest pain. Stress-Induced Asthma Some people find the signs and symptoms of asthma flare up in certain stressful situations: Exercise-induced asthma \u2013 is triggered or flared up during exercise. These symptoms can get worse in cold or dry environments Allergic asthma is triggered by certain allergens such as pollen or pet dander (flakes of skin in animal fur or skin) Occupational asthma is usually triggered by irritants at the workplace including gases, dust or chemical fumes When to Seek Medical Treatment Related Stories COVID-19 pandemic associated with increased anxiety and asthma symptoms in asthma sufferers Study finds striking epigenetic differences in the airway cells of adult children born to asthmatic mothers Disinfectant use by pregnant women may increase risk for asthma and eczema in children Severe and sudden asthma attacks can be fatal. Hence people with asthma should be in touch with their doctor and get advice on what to do in case signs and symptoms of asthma worsen and when to go to the emergency room. Points to keep in mind are as follows: Intermittent coughing or wheezing or any other signs of asthma that lasts for a few days need treatment at the right time, which helps prevent long-term damage to lungs. Asthma needs constant monitoring. Keeping symptoms under control helps preventing a fatal asthma attack . If signs and symptoms get worse, use a quick-relief inhaler. If medications don't seem to work towards controlling the symptoms, seek immediate medical intervention. Overuse of asthma medications can cause serious side effects and also make asthma worse. Review symptoms and treatment from time to time as asthma signs keep changing over time. Regular doctor visits to discuss the changing symptoms are crucial to make any treatment adjustments required over time. It is easy to confuse symptoms of asthma with other conditions such as a cold or bronchitis. In the case of a persistent cough, wheezing or shortness of breath, especially at night, it will be good to seek the advice of a health care provider. It is also helpful to monitor the symptoms by noting them down for a few days before seeing a doctor. Also note down the time of the day or night that symptoms occur and the place and activity at the time. This log of symptoms will help the doctor in finalizing the diagnosis and prescribing the right treatment.

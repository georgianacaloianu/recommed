Last week I was on my period & randomly got a pain across my lower back & down the top of both my legs making it painful to stand or walk for long periods but I was fine if sat down or laying down. Also very bloated. I assumed it was connected to my period but once my period ended - the leg & back pain subsided but I’m now left with a pain in my left groin - that randomly moves to the left side of my hip but mainly is a dull ache in my left groin. I’m also experiencing gas in my lower groin- whereby I can hear it bubble & am still bloated. It’s worse in the morning when I wake up & once I’ve pooed it eases off a bit. Poop is soft (always has been). I also have ovarian cysts that come & go so I was wondering if it was cyst related or ibs related? Other than that I’m fine in myself, I have an appetite, no fever etc… Anyone else experience this with ibs?\""
